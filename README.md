# **README for HTTP Status Code API and Virtual Assistant API**

## **Introduction**

The **HTTP Status Code API** is a tool to help developers learn and understand HTTP status codes. It allows users to input a status code and returns a detailed message about what the code means. This API is particularly useful for students, new developers, and anyone trying to master HTTP communication.
